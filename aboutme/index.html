 <h2>William Tshani</h2>
 <p>Hi everyone, my name is William. I am doing programming and web depvelopment.
 <p>I am married with three beautiful daughters. I love reading books as my hobbies.</p>
 <p>What I love about BYU-Idaho is that the spiritual and the secular go hand in hand.</br>
    My interest in programming and web development came about as a result of working </br>
    on church websites as a translator and content editor. I was fascinated by the </br>
    miracle of it, that is why I chose to study it.</p>
 <p>I have been a member of the church for 21 years this year. One of my favorite </br>
    quotes is from Brigham Young: "I shall not cease learning while I live, nor when </br>
    I arrive in the spirit-world; but shall there learn with greater facility; and when </br>
    I again receive my body, I shall learn a thousand times more in a thousand times less</br>
    time; and then I do not mean to cease learning, but shall still continue my researches."</p> 
 <p>I am looking forward to working with you all this semester.</p>
