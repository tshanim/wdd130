                <h2>Inga Falls on the infamous Congo River</h2>
                <p>Water falls have formed in a sharp bend of the Congo River - the world's second largest river in terms of water volume. This giant river squeezes in an incredibly narrow channel - sometimes less than 260 m wide - and winds its way between mountain ranges.</p>
                <p>The Inga Falls in the lower Congo River is one of its largest groups of rapids, formed in a sharp bend of the river. Its width fluctuates from over 4 km to just 260 m. It has a median flow of 42,476 m続/s (1,500,000 ft続/s) and a maximum recorded volume of 70,793 m続/s (2,500,000 ft続/s).</p>
                <p>In some of its parts, there are underwater cascades, where the stream passes rock thresholds, throttles up and falls deep into invisible canyons above the water. This giant, fast-flowing, extremely deep river is home to unique fish species found nowhere else in the world. There are also various kinds of reptiles, semiaquatic tortoises, and several species of water snakes.</p>

                    <h2>Is whitewater rafting in the Inga Falls safe?</h2>
                    <p>The Inga rapids are deadly. However, its unfounded beauty continues to attract many people interested in whitewater rafting. Over the years, the sport has become safer thanks to increased expertise and better, more specialized equipment.</p>
                    <p>Inga Falls offers its rafters 6 classes or levels of whitewater rafting, which include: </p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="items">Class I: this is the basic level of whitewater rafting, where rafting takes place in small areas of rough water.</li>
                            <li class="items">Class II: this is the second level up from the first, with small areas of rough water and small rocks, requiring only good paddling skills.</li>
                            <li class="items">Class III: this class requires a certain amount of rafting experience, with small waves and little danger.</li>
                            <li class="items">Class IV: this class requires exceptional whitewater rafting skills, as the waves get bigger, and there may be a considerable difference in altitude.</li>
                            <li class="items">Class V: this class requires total rafting mastery, as the waves are bigger, the volume greater, and the possibility of large rocks and danger.</li>
                            <li class="items">Class VI: this is the most dangerous class, where rafters venture into the rapids, requiring total rafting mastery and even then, it is not always safe.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>These whitewater rafting classes depend on rafting mastery. The choice of rafter is first double checked to see if he or she has mastered rafting before going. This is essential to minimize loss of life, especially in these rafts.</p>
