                <h2>Inga Falls on the infamous Congo River</h2>
                <p>The falls have formed in a sharp bend of the Congo River - the world's second largest river in terms of water volume and the tenth longest in the world. This giant river squeezes in an incredibly narrow channel - sometimes less than 260 m wide - and winds its way between mountain ranges. The Inga Falls constitute one of the largest groups of rapids on the lower Congo River, formed in a sharp bend of the river whose width fluctuates from over 4 km to just 260 m. With a median flow of 42,476 m続/s (1,500,000 ft続/s), the Inga Falls can be the largest in the world, with a maximum recorded volume of 70,793 m続/s (2,500,000 ft続/s).</p>
                <p>In some parts of Inga Falls, there are underwater cascades, where the stream passes rock thresholds, throttles up and falls deep into invisible canyons above the water. Inga Falls is also the site of two large hydroelectric dams, Inga I, and Inga II, as well as two planned dams, Inga III and the Grand Inga Dam, the latter being the largest (in terms of energy production) in the world. No wonder: the mighty Congo River forms whirlpools more than 10 m wide. There are countless cliffs and the river's velocity often reaches 50 km/h. The river has sunk deep into the rock - it is the deepest riverbed in the world, with a known depth of 220 m.</p>
                <p>This giant, fast-flowing, extremely deep river is home to unique fish species found nowhere else in the world. In total, over 300 species of fish are known to live in the Inga Falls region, but it is highly likely that many more remain to be discovered.These waters are also home to various kinds of reptiles, semiaquatic tortoises and several species of water snakes.</p>

                    <h2>Is white water rafting in the Inga Falls safe?</h2>
                    <p>The Inga rapids are deadly. However, its unfounded beauty continues to attract many people interested in whitewater rafting, who want the chance to go rafting on one of the longest rivers in the world. Thousands of people enjoy rafting in complete safety and, what's more, the sport has become safer over the years thanks to increased expertise and better, more specialized equipment.</p>
                    <p>Inga Falls offers its rafters 6 classes or levels of whitewater rafting, which include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Class I: this is the basic level of whitewater rafting, where rafting takes place in small areas of rough water.</li>
                            <li>Class II: this is the second level up from the first, with small areas of rough water and small rocks, requiring only good paddling skills.</li>
                            <li>Class III: This class requires a certain amount of rafting experience, with small waves and little danger.</li>
                            <li>Class IV: This class requires exceptional white-water rafting skills, as the waves are bigger than those of level 3, and there may be a considerable difference in altitude.</li>
                            <li>Class V: this class requires total rafting mastery, as the waves are bigger, the volume greater, and the possibility of large rocks and danger.</li>
                            <li>Class VI: this is the most dangerous class, where rafters venture into the rapids for rafting, which requires total rafting mastery and even then, it is not always safe.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>These whitewater rafting classes depend on rafting mastery. The choice of rafter is first double checked to see if he or she has mastered rafting before going. This is essential to minimize loss of life, especially in these rafts.</p>
